# Adaptive_Story_Game_using_Data_Structures

The Adaptive Story Game is an interactive narrative-driven application crafted using the tkinter library in Python for the purpose of graphical interface with the user. This project aims to provide an immersive storytelling experience by implementing a decision-making system. The game utilizes a hierarchical data structure to manage branching storylines, offering diverse choices at each juncture. Through a user-friendly graphical interface, players navigate a web of choices, each leading to distinct outcomes, seamlessly progressing the narrative. By integrating decisionmaking mechanics and intricate storylines, this project demonstrates the power of data structures in creating engaging and adaptive storytelling experiences. It serves as an educational and entertaining tool, showcasing the potential of data structures for crafting interactive narratives and engaging users in captivating, personalized storytelling adventures. By employing depth first search algorithm, we also create an effective credit score system to track the max number of points that could be scored by the user in the game and also display the current points scored by the user in the gameplay.
